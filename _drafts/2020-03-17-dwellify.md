  <p>Dwellify is actually a pair of apps, one customer facing and the other contractor facing. I was the lead iOS developer on both apps which formed the greater part of my work at <a href="/immediaC">immediaC</a> over a year and a half. I worked in collaboration with an Android developer, a project manager and the clients backend team.</p>
  
  <p class="pt-3">After completing the project I was laid off, which was disapointing because I really enjoyed the work. For whatever reason the client has not released the apps to the app store. You can check out their website which is very similar to the customer facing app at <a href="https://dwellify.com" target="blank">dwellify.com</a></p>

  <p class="pt-3">Obviously I can't share the source code but I think it's reasonable to show some screeshots that I took during the development process because I did a lot of work on this app and it was a great experience.</p>

  <p class="pt-3">Some of the challenges with the app included working with a complex REST api with an unusual format. Building custom components the most challenging of which where some different custom calendars. The navigation flow was also complicated to say the least.</p>
