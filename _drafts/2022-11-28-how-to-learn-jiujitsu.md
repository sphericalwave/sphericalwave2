Came across some advice that seems valuable from Jon Thomas on youtube.
 - Basically the approach is record yourself rolling
 - Review your rolls and identify a few problems your having
 - Ask senior belts for suggestion on techniques and videos with the solutions
 - do specific sparring where you work on that particular technique
 - gradually increase the resistance of that specific sparring

 So for example,
  - imagine you've reviewed your rolls and you're getting mushed by a blackbelt in bottom side.
  - You review the video and see that he's sprawling on your inside hip and block
 your far hip with his elbow on the far side.
  - you covertly ask other black belts how they escape that position
  - or maybe you refer to the scrolls of Danaher or youtube for a technique or two
  - then you practice specific sparring applying that escape technique
  - as you start to have success ask your training partner to increase their pressure
