try to disprove things because you can never truly prove anything

The principle you're referring to is rooted in the philosophy of science and epistemology. This principle suggests that we should strive to disprove hypotheses rather than seek to prove them. Here’s a detailed explanation:

### 1. **The Problem of Induction**
The process of induction involves drawing general conclusions from specific observations. For example, if we observe that the sun has risen every day of our lives, we might conclude that the sun will rise every day in the future. However, this method has inherent uncertainty. No matter how many times we observe the sun rising, it does not logically guarantee that it will rise tomorrow. This is known as the problem of induction, famously discussed by philosopher David Hume.

### 2. **Karl Popper's Falsifiability**
Karl Popper, a 20th-century philosopher of science, argued that scientific theories can never be proven true, but they can be falsified. According to Popper:
- **Falsifiability**: A hypothesis or theory should be framed in such a way that it can be tested and potentially proven false.
- **Empirical Testing**: Science progresses by conjectures and refutations. We propose hypotheses and then attempt to disprove them through empirical testing. If a hypothesis withstands rigorous testing and attempts at falsification, it is considered robust but not proven.

### 3. **Asymmetry Between Proof and Disproof**
- **Proof**: To prove a universal statement (e.g., "All swans are white"), we would need to observe every instance of the subject (every swan) and confirm the predicate (being white). This is practically impossible.
- **Disproof**: To disprove the same universal statement, we only need one counterexample (one black swan). This is often much more feasible.

### 4. **Scientific Method and Null Hypothesis**
In scientific research:
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The default position that there is no effect or no difference. Researchers often start with the null hypothesis and design experiments to test it.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The hypothesis that there is an effect or a difference, which researchers aim to support.
The goal is to collect evidence that could potentially reject the null hypothesis, thereby providing support for the alternative hypothesis. This approach aligns with the principle of falsification.

### 5. **Uncertainty and Tentative Knowledge**
Science acknowledges that all knowledge is tentative and subject to revision based on new evidence. Even well-supported theories are not seen as absolute truths but as the best explanations we have given the current evidence.

### Summary
- **Disproving vs. Proving**: Disproving (falsification) is a more robust approach because a single counterexample can invalidate a hypothesis, whereas proving would require exhaustive and often impossible confirmation of every instance.
- **Continuous Testing**: Science advances through the continuous testing and potential falsification of hypotheses, leading to more refined and reliable theories over time.
- **Tentative Nature of Knowledge**: Scientific knowledge is always provisional, open to revision in light of new evidence or better explanations.

In essence, the strategy of attempting to disprove hypotheses helps ensure the rigor and reliability of scientific knowledge, acknowledging the limitations of proof and the dynamic nature of understanding.
