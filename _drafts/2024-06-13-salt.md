<h2>Why do you think salt is bad for you?</h2>

<p>I remember my Grand Father had trouble with arteriosclerosis. He was on all kinds of questionable pills. I don't know what they are but I'm sure a doctor was making commision on them while not solving the problem. That was one of the earliest cases where I noticed that doctors don't solve problems. Anyway I remember my grand mother would always bug him about putting salt on his food. My mother copied the same pattern. I learned later that when questioned about why is salt bad I never got a rational answer. The truth is it was just a belief created through repetition and appeal to authority, in this case the doctor said don't eat too much salt or you'll die.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Our bodies contain almost 450 grams of salt and each day we need to replenish the salt used by our bodies to maintain our normal health, vigor and alkaline design.</li>
    <li>Salt plays a big part in helping the body to digest food and turn them into living tissues, as well as helping to transmit nerve impulses that contract the muscles. In order for the cells of the body to function normally, a salt/water balance must be maintained. Salt is also necessary for making the sodium bicarbonate the body needs to alkalize the food we eat to maintaining the alkalinity of the blood and lymph fluids.</li>
    <li>When you are tired and/or fatigued and need energy that is the need for salt. All sugar cravings are the need for salt.</li>
    <li>Salt is the ion of life in which all energy is transported. Without salt there is no life.</li>
    <li>Salt is what keeps the spirit body connected or joined with the physical body and mental body.</li>
  </ul>
