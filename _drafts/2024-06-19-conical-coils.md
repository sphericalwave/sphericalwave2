Bench demo of Russell's conical coils focusing magnetic matter into a Sphere.

They display some interesting magnetic effects that I'd like to look into.

"there is no inward pull", when you open the the fridge door, you wrap your fingers around and push from the other side, your car doesn't pull a trailer, the tow ball pushes the inside of the trailers coupling, a vacuum cleaner doesn't pull dirt in, the fan blades push atmosphere out, creating a low pressure inside and the high pressure outside pushes the dirt in, unlike poles of two magnets don't pull, they void each other to make one magnet, i understand this, i am nobody, mainstream science needs to do better, be better. - @westernfloracaravanpark59
