      <p>resonate at the frequency you wish to operate</p>  
      feeling is the secret  
      and you have the power to manufacture feelings  

      think about something that you would be happy about    
      maybe it's a certain car, a house, a snowboarding trick  
      maybe it's seeing the numbers in your bitcoin account ticking up 1 bitcoin at a time

discipline equals freedom  
track your progress with a spreadsheet  
take notes and treat it like a science experiment  
repetition is the mother of skill  
belief is a function of repetition  
seeing is believing  
and you'll see it when you believe it  
that's not to say you won't have work to do  
but if you're honest with yourself you're mostly along for the ride  
while your subconscious runs the show  
the key to the paradox is to use your imaginative mind like a trimtab  
initially your unconscious is a disordered mess  
a collection of all your experiences and conclusions  
as you continue to focus your imagination on a specific outcome  
you're unconscious starts to get it  
and once it starts looking for what you've been imaging  
magic starts to happen  
is it literal magic?  
possibly  
there are so many ways to look at how it works  
quantum mechanics  
mysticism  
reticular activating system  
the mechanism is interesting but results are the focus  
stay on target for a solid year then lets talk  

# how specifically do you structure your practice?  
there's no clear best way  
you can write out your goals over and over  
you can read your goals in the mirror  
you can meditate, relax and visualize  
you can find the feeling of the wish fulfilled and keep building on it  
you can make a mind movie in iMovie with slides of your goals
