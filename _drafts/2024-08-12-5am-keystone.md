Embracing the early hours can make a significant difference in various aspects of life, from productivity to mental well-being.


Waking up early has never been my strong suit  
In fact I suck at it  
But it the time you wake up is the first thing you do every day.  
What could be more important than that?

The 5 AM Keystone Habit concept revolves around the idea of waking up at 5 AM to establish a powerful, foundational habit that can positively impact the rest of your day and life.   
This early wake-up time is considered a "keystone habit," meaning it's a habit that can trigger a cascade of other positive behaviors and routines.  
By waking up early, you gain extra time for activities that enhance your well-being, such as exercise, meditation, planning, or personal development.  
The idea is that starting your day with intentional, productive activities sets a positive tone, helping you build momentum and discipline that carries into other areas of your life, ultimately leading to greater overall success and fulfillment.
