I recomend heading over to BJJ fanatics and downloading John's Solo Drills. As he points out in the video, movement is more fundamental than the moves of jiujitsu. Jiujitsu has a unique collection of body movements that are used in the techniques of the sport. John's done an incredible job documenting the art of jiujijtsu, this free offering is worth the investment of energy. When you use biomechanically correct technique your jiujitsu takes off as post training aches and pain fall away!
