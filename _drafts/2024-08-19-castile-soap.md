      <p>Castile soap is a versatile, biodegradable soap traditionally made from olive oil, though modern versions may include other plant-based oils like coconut or hemp. Originating from the Castile region of Spain, this soap is prized for its gentle, moisturizing properties, making it suitable for a wide range of uses, including personal care, household cleaning, and even pet care. It is free from synthetic detergents and harsh chemicals, making it a popular choice for those seeking natural, eco-friendly cleaning solutions.</p>

      <p>Castile soap is named after the Castile region in Spain, where it originated. The region was known for producing high-quality olive oil, which was the primary ingredient in the original formulation of this soap. The name "Castile" became synonymous with this type of pure, olive oil-based soap, distinguishing it from other soaps that used animal fats or synthetic ingredients.</p>

      <p>The pH of Castile soap typically ranges between 9 and 10, making it mildly alkaline. This pH level is higher than that of neutral water (pH 7) but lower than many harsh cleaning products, allowing Castile soap to effectively clean while remaining gentle on the skin.</p>

        <p>Castile soap can be applied to the skin and left on as a gentle support for the skin's natural functions. 
        Its mildly alkaline pH helps neutralize excess acidity that may be eliminated through the skin via perspiration. 
        By increasing the skin's pH, Castile soap is charging your skin with electrons, 
        supporting the skin's barrier function, and promoting overall skin health without the need for rinsing.</p>

        <p>You can also use it as toothpaste that donates electrons. 
        Which is great for your teeth. 
        It tastes fine and brings new meaning to the phrase "wash your mouth out with soap." 
        Better than this fluoride based poison the dentists are peddling.</p>

      <p>Castile soap has proven effective in addressing skin conditions like ringworm, 
      thanks to its natural, gentle formulation. The theoretical mechanism is that the soap raises the pH of the skin in the local area and the fungus requires and acidic terrain to exist. If you change the pH the fungus loses it's power source. Ideally you're increasing your pH via alkaline water, alkaline foods and fasting. But as =you know life is not always ideal.

      <p>Additionally, it is beneficial for softening hardened ears, a common issue for those engaged in wrestling and jiu-jitsu. 
      The soap's moisturizing properties and ability to balance the skin's pH make it a versatile solution for these and other skin-related concerns.</p>
