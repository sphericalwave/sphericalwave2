<p>The Enneagram is a personality typing system that describes nine distinct and interconnected personality types. It is used as a tool for personal growth, self-awareness, and understanding human behavior. Each of the nine types represents a different way of thinking, feeling, and acting, and the Enneagram provides insights into the motivations, fears, and desires that drive each type.</p>
    
<h2>Origins and History</h2>
<hr class="blue1 mb-3 mt-1">
<h3>Ancient Roots</h3>
<p>The origins of the Enneagram are somewhat unclear, with influences from various ancient spiritual and philosophical traditions, including Sufism, Christianity, and early Greek philosophy. The symbol of the Enneagram itself, a nine-pointed figure within a circle, has ancient roots, though its exact origin is debated.</p>

<h3>Modern Development</h3>
<p>The modern Enneagram system was largely developed in the 20th century by figures such as George Gurdjieff, a mystic and spiritual teacher, and later by Oscar Ichazo, a Bolivian spiritual teacher, who formalized the system and associated the nine points with specific personality types. Claudio Naranjo, a Chilean psychiatrist, further expanded and popularized the Enneagram by connecting it with modern psychology and bringing it to the West, where it gained widespread attention in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
