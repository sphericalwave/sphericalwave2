<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup buckwheat groats</li>
    <li>1 ¾ cups water or broth</li>
    <li>A pinch of salt (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Rinse the Buckwheat:</strong> Start by rinsing the buckwheat groats under cold water to remove any dust or debris.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Ingredients to the Pressure Cooker:</strong> Place the rinsed buckwheat, water (or broth), and salt (if using) into the pressure cooker.</li>
    <li><strong>Pressure Cook:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Pressure:</strong> Set your pressure cooker to high pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooking Time:</strong> Cook the buckwheat for 4 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Natural Release:</strong> After the cooking time is up, allow the pressure to release naturally for about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Fluff and Serve:</strong> Once the pressure has fully released, open the lid, and fluff the buckwheat with a fork. It's now ready to serve!</li>
</ol>

<h4>Tips</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> If you prefer a softer texture, increase the cooking time to 5 minutes. For a firmer texture, reduce the time slightly.</li>
    <li><strong>Flavor Enhancements:</strong> You can add herbs, spices, or a knob of butter after cooking to enhance the flavor of the buckwheat.</li>
</ul>
